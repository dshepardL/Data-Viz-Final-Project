Data Visualization, Final Deliverables

Project Title:
Citizen engagement and local government; a complicated relationship.

	Utilizing 440 insights pulled from interviews with individiuals throughout the United States, I have developed a quantitative breakdown of the barriers and opportunities for increasing citizen engagement with their local government to address issues in their communities.  
	
	These categories have been grouped under 4 umbrella themes - Role of individual, role of Government, Local issues and Communication. These groupings are a product of most common concerns and experiences that came up throughout our interview process.
