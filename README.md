Data Visualization, Final Deliverables

Project Title:
Citizen engagement and local government; a complicated relationship.

	Utilizing 440 insights pulled from interviews with individiuals throughout the United States, I have developed a quantitative breakdown of the barriers and opportunities for increasing citizen engagement with their local government to address issues in their communities.  
	
	These categories have been grouped under 4 umbrella themes - Role of individual, Role of Government, Local issues and Communication. These groupings are a product of the most common concerns and experiences that came up throughout our interview process. The most upstream goal of this research is to better understand how citizen could address the issues of environmental sustainabilty in their with their local government (a leverage point we had identified as very powerful).
	
	The work for this thesis included over 80 interviews with subject matter experts (polic makers, politicians, political candidates, advocacy organizations, as well as, everyday citizens with varying levels of civic engagement throughout the country. The research began in March of 2018 and we have pulled together a robust dataset which includes over 440 insights from interviews (I've narrowed down to 440 to address those that are directly in scope for this project).
	
	I wanted to create a visual that was based off of this quantitiative data to serve three goals. 
		1. Help give language to those are are interacting with the final visual to see where they may fall in the larger landscape of citizen enggement and give them some language for what they may feel as a general sense of frustration with local government.
		2. Help to identify an entrypoint for innovation - the most frequent barriers and opportunities will help us design an intervention that will be best informed to have impact.
		3. Help those that are deeply entrenched in the world of advocacy, policy-making, and civic education. Many individuals we interviewed that are deeply immersed in this work actually have trouble seeing the nuance of why people still don't vote - or address their concerns. I'm hoping to provide some clarity for those that can't see the forest among the trees. 

Process:

There was a lot of data sorting and a steep technical learning curve for me with this project. The dataset I was working off of had to be sorted and re-organized in 3 different excel documents so that I could accurately build it into a hierarchal dataset. I was insistant on a hierarhcal strucuttre, because i think this is most true to reality in terms of people's realtionship with the government - there are many layers to the barriers, or opportunities they experience and I wanted to visual to accurately reflect that. 

Once the data was accurately structured, I played around with the output in excel (as a Sunburst diagram or a Tree Map). I showes the drafts to several indidivuals to see which style was most clear and impactful - all voted for the sunburst chart. I wanted the visual to be really clean. I wanted to labels to be easy to read and the colors to be sharp and distinct - there was no way this was going to happen in excel, so I made the choice to learn Adobe Illustrator (I've never used it before).

After a lot of tutorial videos and help from friends I got a grasp on Illustrator and got to work designing different layers of data and trying out different fonts and colors to end on the final visual. It was also really important that this chart be interactive, so I also learned how to use Invision and built an interactive experience I feel really proud of. With the new interactivity you can select each barrier or opportunity section to get a cleaner view of the data. You can click on the sub-categories within each theme and read the direct quotes from our interviews.

Additionally, my visual is part of a larger set of deliverables from my thesis partner's that are telling other parts of the citizen engagement story. Corinne has a wonderful breakdown of how all of our pieces fit together laid out here:Â https://gist.github.com/corinnereynolds/58e88ed965f0459afb70498b92ea94a7

I learned A LOT from this project. Aside from some tech skills I never had before, I also learend what it means to be a designer in the data viz world. It's weird feeling to have to make decisions about how data is used and what kind of story you want it to tell. I have a new found love of quantitative data and this definitely will not be the last time I navigate a complicated social space (feelings about the government) with real data to help the cause.
